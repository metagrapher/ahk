# AutoHotKey scripts

Mostly just a personal repository to sync my AutoHotKey scripts among machines. This also simplifies initial desktop environment setup and allows me to use Vagrant to set my environment up everywhere, although that is not at all part of this repository.

Feel free to use these scripts as you see fit. Vim is actually taken from somewhere else, and I definitely need to add attribution, so please know that script is not mine to share, but is available from another repository. This is not any kind of official fork, nor is that repository linked here.
