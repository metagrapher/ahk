# AutoHotKey scripts

Mostly just a personal repository to sync my AutoHotKey scripts among machines. This also simplifies initial desktop environment setup and allows me to use Vagrant to set my environment up everywhere, although that is not at all part of this repository.

Feel free to use these scripts as you see fit, except for use in projects that are for sale. Personal use while working on paid projects is fine. Really as long as you aren't distributing or modifying this for money we shouldn't have issues. If you want to do that, contact me and we'll work something out.

Vim is actually taken from https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk so please know that script is not mine to share, but is available from that repository. This is not any kind of official fork, nor is that repository linked here beyond this readme and in the file.
